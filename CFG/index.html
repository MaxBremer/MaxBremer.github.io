<h2>CFG Creator.</h2>
<h3>By Max Bremer yay</h3>
<p>This is an interpreter for Context-Free Grammars, essentially basic procedural text generation rules. A few things to note, all of which are demonstrated in the demo below:
<ul> 
	<li>*X instantiates new symbol X at start of line, but references existing symbol X if used mid-line.</li>
	<li>All possibilities for X come after the -</li>
	<li>X will choose randomly from its possibilities, the entries divided by |, when its written.</li>
	<li>A symbols possibilities can either be a) a reference to another symbol directly or b) a terminal.</li>
	<li>Terminals can contain further symbol references inside angle brackets.</li>
	<li>Symbol references can be "modified" by adding a period and modifier after the reference inside the angle brackets.</li>
	<li>Current modifiers: .a will correctly prepend a/an depending on reference, .cap will capitalize the first letter, .s will pluralize nouns, .ff will give the symbol a fifty-fifty chance of being included at all, .uncap uncapitalizes the first letter (for some weird cases).</li>
	<li>Modifiers can be chained together and will operate as expected: X.a.cap will write symbol X with a/an prepended and capitalized.</li>
	<li>DONT CREATE INFINITE LOOPS OF SYMBOLS. You can. Don't do it.</li>
	<li>There <b>must</b> be a symbol with the name "S". This will serve as the start symbol for processing, and writing starts at symbol S. </li>
	<li>All used characters (|"-*&lt;) are forbidden from symbol names, though only " is forbidden from terminals for the obvious reason.</li>
</ul></p>
